Industrial DataLogger (IoT Comm Board) -
Overview
The Industrial DataLogger (IoT Comm Board) is a versatile hardware platform designed for IoT systems, remote monitoring, and industrial automation applications. It is built around the ATmega2560 microcontroller and supports multiple communication protocols, including RS-485, RS232, LoRa, GSM/3G, and Ethernet. This hub can be used to collect, process, and transmit data from various sensors and devices, making it ideal for real-time data acquisition and control in a wide range of environments.

Features :-
Microcontroller: ATmega2560 with extensive I/O capabilities.
Communication Protocols:-
RS-485: For long-distance wired communication.
RS232: Serial communication for connecting to legacy devices.
LoRa: Low-power, long-range wireless communication.
GSM/3G (SIM7000G): Wireless cellular communication for remote IoT applications.
Ethernet (LAN8720A): Wired network connectivity for local or internet access.
Data Logging: MicroSD card interface for data storage and logging.
ADC (MCP3424): High-resolution 4-channel ADC for accurate sensor readings.
Power Regulation: Includes AMS1117 and LM39302R-ADJ voltage regulators for 5V and 3.3V power supplies.
Applications
IoT Systems: Wireless monitoring and control of smart devices.
Industrial Automation: Real-time data acquisition and control systems.
Remote Monitoring: Collect and transmit sensor data over cellular networks or Ethernet.
Data Logging: Store sensor data locally on a MicroSD card for later analysis.
